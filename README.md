## ‚ö° Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yemmmyc/hng-stage1-devops.git
cd hng-stage1-devops
chmod +x deploy.sh
Create .gitignore
Ignore all logs except deploy.log:

gitignore
Copy code
*.log
!deploy.log
Run the deployment script

bash
Copy code
./deploy.sh
When prompted, press Enter for default values or paste your PAT when requested.

üìÇ Logs
All actions are logged to deploy.log

Timestamped logs (deploy_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log) are created for each run

Helps in troubleshooting and auditing deployments

‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
Port conflicts: Script auto-switches if a port is in use

Network issues: Ensure internet and Docker Hub access

Container conflicts: Remove old containers manually:

bash
Copy code
docker rm -f landing_page
docker rmi landing_page_image
